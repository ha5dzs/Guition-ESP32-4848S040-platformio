# Guition ESP32-4848S040 PlatformIO project

This is not like the included examples, these use the latest Arduino GFX (1.5.6) and slightly more recent LVGL (8.4.0) libraries. I am doing this because I got frustrated that everyone seem to use the older libraries and the code was a mess. Also, there are breaking changes in the newer versions, which should at least be tested. I did this so I can use this as a skeleton for my projects.

I wrote this as I found and solved problems. There is no structure to speak of, it is merely a sequence of what broke when.

## Key differences

* Uses Arduino framework on PlatformIO
* Custom header file for driving hardware
* Touch panel and screen now can be rotated together

## What is on the board

* Expressif ESP32-S3-N16R8
* Goodix GT911 on the capacitive touch panel
* 480x480 IPS screen, using the ST7701 controller. Configuration is via SPI, wired for 16-bit parallel load
* USB is directly wired to a CH340 chip, so no fancy USB stuff here
* IP5306 for battery management - no direct control from the ESP32 module, but the secret button on the side is wired to it
* Some boost converter for the backlight LEDs I couldn't find the datasheet of
* NS4168 IÂ²S DAC and apparently a 2.5W Class-D amplifier (smoorez would say that's a good SPERKER)
* Relays are switched though J3Y NPN transistors
* The UART RX and TX on the P1 and H1 headers are connected together
* RST and BOOT buttons are hidden inside the back panel - you won't really need them, the CH340's RTS and DTR pins are wired to them too

## Environment set-up

The IO pins are defined in `src/Guition_ESP32_4848S040.h`. The device on board is an ESP32-S3-N16R8, so it has 16 MB (Quiad SPI) Flash, and 8 MB (Octal SPI) PSRAM.

The `platformio.ini` is slightly customised so that the appropriate amount of memory is selected

```ini
[env:Guition_ESP32_4848S040]
platform = espressif32
framework = arduino
board = esp32-s3-devkitm-1
; A couple of overrides.
board_build.arduino.memory_type = qio_opi
board_build.flash_mode = qio
board_build.psram_type = opi
board_upload.flash_size = 16MB
board_upload.maximum_size = 16777216
monitor_speed = 115200
build_flags =
    -UARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=0  ; We have a ch340 chip on its uart
    -DBOARD_HAS_PSRAM
    -DLV_CONF_INCLUDE_SIMPLE
lib_deps =
    https://github.com/moononournation/Arduino_GFXl
    lvgl/lvgl@^8.4.0
    https://github.com/tamctec/gt911-arduino
```

In `Setup()`, the available SPI RAM (PSRAM) is the very first thing it prints:

```C
 // Serial port
Serial.begin(115200);
Serial.printf("Available PSRAM: %d KB\n", heap_caps_get_free_size(MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM)>>10);
```

## Display

Even if the datasheet and the schematic says it's loaded in parallel, the control parts are over SPI. For some reason, I only could get it to work with Software SPI, which may cause problems with the SD card later-on.

The code so far:

```C++
// Software SPI
Arduino_DataBus *bus = new Arduino_SWSPI( GFX_NOT_DEFINED /* DC pin */, TFT_CS /* CS pin of display*/, TFT_SCK /* Clock */, TFT_SDA /* MOSI */, GFX_NOT_DEFINED /* Data in */);

// Display hardware definition. The display data is loaded in parallel ST7701.
Arduino_ESP32RGBPanel *rgbpanel = new Arduino_ESP32RGBPanel(
  TFT_DE /* DE */, TFT_VS /* VSYNC */, TFT_HS /* HSYNC */, TFT_PCLK /* PCLK */,
  TFT_R0_DB13 /* R0 */, TFT_R1_DB14 /* R1 */, TFT_R2_DB15 /* R2 */, TFT_R3_DB16 /* R3 */, TFT_R4_DB17 /* R4 */,
  TFT_G0_DB6 /* G0 */, TFT_G1_DB7 /* G1 */, TFT_G2_DB8 /* G2 */, TFT_G3_DB9 /* G3 */, TFT_G4_DB10 /* G4 */, TFT_G5_DB11 /* G5 */,
  TFT_B0_DB1 /* B0 */, TFT_B1_DB2 /* B1 */, TFT_B2_DB3 /* B2 */, TFT_B3_DB4 /* B3 */, TFT_B4_DB5 /* B4 */,
  TFT_HSYNC_POLARITY /* 0 or 1? */, TFT_HSYNC_FRONT_PORCH, TFT_HSYNC_PULSE_WIDTH, TFT_HSYNC_BACK_PORCH,
  TFT_VSYNC_POLARITY /* 0 or 1? */, TFT_VSYNC_FRONT_PORCH, TFT_VSYNC_PULSE_WIDTH, TFT_VSYNC_BACK_PORCH,
  TFT_PCLK_ACTIVE_NEG /* Active low? Falling edge? */, TFT_DATA_SPEED, TFT_USE_BIG_ENDIAN
);


// As of Adrduino_GFX 1.5.5:
Arduino_RGB_Display *tft = new Arduino_RGB_Display(
  TFT_WIDTH, TFT_HEIGHT, rgbpanel, ROTATION, TFT_AUTO_FLUSH,
  bus /* Arduino Data bus */, GFX_NOT_DEFINED /* Reset pin, internal*/,
  st7701_type9_init_operations, sizeof(st7701_type9_init_operations)
);
```

....and then

```C++
tft->begin();
tft->do_whatever(what_other_ever_input);
tft->flush(); // So that I can control the flushing from LVGL.
```

There is some test code that creates a bunch of colourful pixels. This is a low-level thing that proves that the display library is accessing the screen properly.

## LVGL

I kinda gave up on lvgl 9, because I had to allocate the entire frame buffer in the SPI RAM, and all I got is garbage on the screen. [According to this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/7402), someone solved this by setting `SPIRAM_MALLOC_ALWAYSINTERNAL` to 0 or at least a very low number. So anything more than X bytes would automatically be shoved to the SPI RAM.

Instead, I switched back to lvgl 8.4.0, which worked pretty much instantly.

In order to do this, one needs to change this line in `platformio.ini`:

```ini
lib_deps=
    lvgl/lvgl@^8.4.0
```

Generally speaking, there are a number of prerequisites to use LVGL.

### The *tick callback function* that is executed periodically.

To me, this seems to work, and I don't have to put anything in `Loop()`:

```C
#include <Ticker.h>
#includ <lvgl.h>

#define TICKER_MS 5

// Ticker
Ticker ticker;

//This function is executed every LVGL_TICKER_MS milliseconds.
void ticker_call_function(void)
{
  // Since the serial port here doesn't work, I blink the backlight.
  //digitalWrite(TFT_BL, !digitalRead(TFT_BL)); // Oldest trick in the book.
  lv_tick_inc(TICKER_MS);
  lv_task_handler();
}

void setup()
{
  // Ticker
  ticker.attach_ms(TICKER_MS, ticker_call_function);
}
```

### Display driver and buffer allocation

In LVGL 8, there is the `draw_buffer` where the local graphic mambo-jambo happens, the `frame_buffer` or `display_buffer`, there the actual picture data is stored. In the Guition ESP32-4848S040 board, the display is directly (HSync - VSync - Pixel Clock, 16-bit RGB data) driven, so it seems that the display may need to be fully refreshed every time.

Storing a 480x480 display in 16-bit colour depth needs about 450 kB of memory, which is more than the ESP32's internal SRAM. Luckily, the board came with the N16R8 variant, so there is a whopping extra 8 MB RAM available.

To access this RAM, one needs to allocate this with `heap_caps_malloc( <x_number_of_bytes>), MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM | MALLOC_CAP_8BIT);`

lvgl 8 also needs a `display_driver` pointer, which is used to configure where is where. It also turned out that the entire screen does NOT need to be re-drawn all the time. So probably in lvgl 9, one could use `LV_DISPLAY_RENDER_MODE_PARTIAL` instead of `LV_DISPLAY_RENDER_MODE_DIRECT`

```C
#include <lvgl.h>
// Main pointers
static lv_disp_draw_buf_t draw_buffer;
static lv_color_t *frame_buffer;
static lv_disp_drv_t display_driver;


void Setup()
{
  // Initialise an entire frame's buffer in the SPI RAM
  frame_buffer = (lv_color_t *)heap_caps_malloc(sizeof(lv_color_t) * TFT_WIDTH * TFT_HEIGHT, MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM | MALLOC_CAP_8BIT);

  // If the PSRAM is not initialised, this should fail. 480x480x2=460800 -> 450 kB
  if(frame_buffer == NULL)
  {
    Serial.println("Unable to allocate memory for the frame buffer. Do you have enough PSRAM?\n");
    while(1);
  }

  // Initialise draw buffer, and assign it to the frame buffer.
  lv_disp_draw_buf_init(&draw_buffer, frame_buffer, NULL, TFT_WIDTH * TFT_HEIGHT);

  // Initialise the display driver, and set some basic details.
  lv_disp_drv_init(&display_driver);
  display_driver.hor_res = TFT_WIDTH;
  display_driver.ver_res = TFT_HEIGHT;
  display_driver.flush_cb = my_disp_flush; // Assign callback for display update
  display_driver.full_refresh = 0; // Always redraw the entire screen.
  display_driver.draw_buf = &draw_buffer; // The memory address where the draw buffer begins

  // Finally, register this display
  lv_disp_drv_register(&display_driver);
}
```

In lvgl 9, the above code changes to:

```C
#include <lvgl.h>

lv_display_t *disp;
// LVGL's internal frane buffer
#define DISPLAY_BUFFER_SIZE TFT_WIDTH * TFT_HEIGHT * 2

void Setup()
{
  lv_init(); // Start

  disp = lv_display_create(TFT_HEIGHT, TFT_WIDTH); // Create display

  void *frame_buffer = heap_caps_malloc(DISPLAY_BUFFER_SIZE, MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM | MALLOC_CAP_8BIT);
  if(buffer == NULL)
  {
    Serial.println("Couldn't allocate memory for the display buffer.");
    while(1);
  }

  lv_display_set_buffers(disp, frame_buffer, NULL, DISPLAY_BUFFER_SIZE, LV_DISPLAY_RENDER_MODE_DIRECT);

  lv_display_set_flush_cb(disp, my_disp_flush); // Callback function for updating the display.
}
```

### The  **flush** function, where the display buffer is being 'uploaded' to the display.

In this case, this is `my_disp_flush()`, which can be seen in oh so many examples.

* LVGL 8:

```C
void my_disp_flush(lv_disp_drv_t *disp, const lv_area_t *area, lv_color_t *color_p)
{
  uint32_t w = (area->x2 - area->x1 + 1);
  uint32_t h = (area->y2 - area->y1 + 1);

  // tft->draw16bitBeRGBBitmap(area->x1, area->y1, (uint16_t *)&color_p->full, w, h) // Swap colours;
  tft->draw16bitRGBBitmap(area->x1, area->y1, (uint16_t *)&color_p->full, w, h);
  tft->flush(); // Do the actual flushing

  lv_disp_flush_ready(disp);
}
```

* LVGL 9:

```C
void my_disp_flush(lv_display_t* disp, const lv_area_t* area, uint8_t* frame_data)
{
  uint32_t w = (area->x2 - area->x1 + 1);
  uint32_t h = (area->y2 - area->y1 + 1);

  // Load the data tot he display
  tft->draw16bitRGBBitmap(area->x1, area->y1, (uint16_t *)&frame_data, w, h);

  // Because auto flush is disabled.
  tft->flush();
  lv_disp_flush_ready(disp);
}
 ```

### Some input device

In this case, the Guition ESP32-4848S040 board has a GT911 touch panel on the screen. The rotations do not correspond, and as of LVGL 8.4.0, there is no multitouch support. LVGL 9 does support gestures though.

In `platformio.ini`, add the library:

```ini
lib_deps=
    https://github.com/tamctec/gt911-arduino
```

Low-level hardware set-up

```C
#include <TAMC_GT911.h>

// Touch object
TAMC_GT911 touch_panel(TP_SDA, TP_SCL, TP_INT, TP_RST, TFT_WIDTH, TFT_HEIGHT);

void Setup()
{
  // Touch panel
  touch_panel.begin();
  // The display rotation is not the same as the touch panel rotation, see Guition_ESP32_4848S040.h
  touch_panel.setRotation(TAMC_GT911_ROTATION);
  touch_panel.setResolution(TFT_WIDTH, TFT_HEIGHT); // During initialisation, it doesn't get the right coordinates
}
```

* LVGL 8:

```C
// Touch panel callback function LVGL 8.4.0 does not support multitouch.
void my_input_read(lv_indev_drv_t *indev_driver, lv_indev_data_t *data)
{
  touch_panel.read();
  {
    if (touch_panel.isTouched)
    {
      data->state = LV_INDEV_STATE_PRESSED;
      // Since no multitouch, get the first point.
      data->point.x = touch_panel.points[0].x;
      data->point.y = touch_panel.points[0].y;
    }
    else
    {
      data->state = LV_INDEV_STATE_RELEASED;
    }
  }
}

void Setup()
{
  // Initialise the touch panel driver
  static lv_indev_drv_t indev_drv;
  lv_indev_drv_init(&indev_drv);
  indev_drv.type = LV_INDEV_TYPE_POINTER; // No multitouch :()
  indev_drv.read_cb = my_input_read; // This is where we read the touch controller
  lv_indev_drv_register(&indev_drv);

}
```

* LVGL 9:

```C
// Touch panel callback function.
void my_input_read(lv_indev_drv_t *indev_driver, lv_indev_data_t *data)
{
  touch_panel.read();
  {
    if (touch_panel.isTouched)
    {
      data->state = LV_INDEV_STATE_PRESSED;
      // Since no multitouch, get the first point.
      data->point.x = touch_panel.points[0].x;
      data->point.y = touch_panel.points[0].y;
    }
    else
    {
      data->state = LV_INDEV_STATE_RELEASED;
    }
  }
}

// LVGL 9 supports multi-touch gestures, but I haven't been able to play with this yet.


void Setup()
{
  // Create input device
  lv_indev_t * indev = lv_indev_create();
  lv_indev_set_type(indev, LV_INDEV_TYPE_POINTER);
  lv_indev_set_read_cb(indev, my_input_read);
}

```

## Adding custom things

There are [some subtle differences between C and C++]( https://community.platformio.org/t/files-in-lib-compile-but-linker-cant-find-them-resolved/10489). I got an example to run by following this structure:

```
âââ src
    âââ custom_thing.h
    âââ custom_thing.c
```

In `custom_thing.h`, add the following:

```C
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

void your_fancy_function(whatever_input_arguments);

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
```
### The wifi selector screens

Since this board does not have an external real-time clock with a backup battery and I don't plan to use a rechargeable battery with it at all, I made a couple of wifi-specific GUI screens that scan for the wifi networks, connects to one of your choice, and then synchronises time. From `main.cpp`, at the end of setup(), the entry point is Ëwifi_ap_list_screen()Ë. If you don't need anything like this, just comment that line out.

While I am learning LVGL myself here, I went through several iterations of the code. I decided that I split each screen with its callback functions to separate files. Each file has one publicly available function to call, which is the GUI screen.

These are:

* `src/wifi_selector_screens/...`
  * `wifi_selector_screens.h` which just includes all the header files.
  * `wifi_ap_list.*` includes the scanning and listing of access points
  * `wifi_manual_ssid_input.*` includes a manual entry for the SSID (if, say, it's not in the list because it's hidden)
  * `wifi_password_input.*` is used when the selected network needs a password
  * `wifi_connect_screen.*` is used when all the relevant data is gathered and connection takes place.

Note that nothing is saved to flash, so once the ESP device resets, you will have to enter these details again. For now.
